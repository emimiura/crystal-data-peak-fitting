# ðŸ’Ž Crystal: A Powder X-ray Diffraction Data Processing App

This app is designed to perform peak fitting and Scherrer equation analysis of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data of nanocrystalline materials.

## Use the app online:

## Disclaimer/Some Info:
This app was written by a haphazard non-computer-software-engineer grad student who would like to quickly and efficiently analyze her PXRD data without the use of more complex peak fitting programs and excel spreadsheets to calculate rough diameters for nanoparticle sizes (hence the chaos of the github repo).
